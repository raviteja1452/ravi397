Git Basics:

git init - initialises a new git project.

Git project has three parts.

1.Working Directory
2.Staging Area
3.Repository

git status - shows the working tree status
git add filename - adds the file to the staging area
git diff filename - tells us about the difference between staging and working directory of a file
git log - log a list your commits

Git Basics:

git init - initialises a new git project.

Git project has three parts.

1.Working Directory
2.Staging Area
3.Repository


git status - shows the working tree status

git add filename - adds the file to the staging area(we can add two files with their names by giving space after each filename)

git diff filename - tells us about the difference between staging and working directory of a file

git log - log a list your commits

HEAD - is a pointer that points generally to the recent commit

git show HEAD - displays log for HEAD commit and the file changes that were committed

git checkout HEAD filename - restore the file in your working directory to look as it did when you last made a commit

git reset HEAD filename - this moves the file from staging area to working directory before commit

git reset SHA - resets the repository to one of the previous commit points using the 7 characters of SHA in previous commits

BRANCHING

git branch - lists all the branches in git project

git branch brach_name - creates a new branch

git checkout branch_name - used to switch from one branch to another

git merge branch_name - used to join files from the branch to current branch

git branch -d branch_name - used to delete branch
